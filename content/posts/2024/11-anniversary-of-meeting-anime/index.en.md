It's almost the 11th anniversary of the day I got into anime.

Ah, I actually don't know the exact day, but I still remember that day, the beautiful scene of sakura fluttering outside the window, just like the sakura tree in D.C. (Da Capo) that I had just finished watching.

## Unintentionally, The Branch Derived from Hatsune Miku

As someone who was completely segregated from girls, I had never been able to enjoy the joy of getting along with girls.

it was the end of January 2013, [Hatsune Miku had saved me from the abyss]({{< relref "posts/2023/11-anniversary-of-meeting-miku/index.en.md" >}}) for a month already. An anime named AKB0048 mentioned in a Miku douji fiction attracted my attention.

{{< figure src="img/Screenshot_2013-01-27-00-40-53.png" caption="Although the resolution of the screen of the thousand-yuan old phone from 2012 was only 480p, the slender and beautiful body of protagonists in the ED alone had already planted the seeds of otaku in someone's heart. (It's also one of the earliest screenshots proving that I started watching Japanese anime.)" link="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1RE411G7Ax?t=7.3&p=2" >}}

In April, the second season finished airing. The moe style girls unique in Japanese anime born the idea of looking for the next anime.

Let's search for some good animes. "Da Capo"? What's this anime? In Chinese, it is translated to ÂàùÈü≥Â≤õ which literally means HatsuneJima, which is true because the place in Da Capo is called HatsuneJima. I was aware that the "Hatsune" part is unrelated to Hatsune Miku (ÂàùÈü≥„Éü„ÇØ). But who cares? It has ‚ÄúHatsune‚Äù! Just yolo and watch it. üòÑ

## As Sakura Flutters, Where Do My Thoughts Fall with the Wind

{{< image src="img/D.C. ÔΩû„ÉÄ„Éª„Ç´„Éº„ÉùÔΩû Blu-ray BOX DISC1 MENU (BD 1920x1080).png" caption="[D.C. ÔΩûDa CapoÔΩû BD](https://share.dmhy.org/topics/view/637016_1080P_FN_Lv_1_D_C_I_II_I_II_BDRip_1920x1080_HEVC_D_C_D_C_S_S_D_C_if_SP_D_C_II_D_C_II_S_S_SP.html) Cover 1, Asakura Nemu and Yoshino Sakura" >}}

Under the forever-blooming sakura tree, a moe and cheerful campus story began.

There's the lively and adorable younger sister, Asakura Nemu; the petite and cute Yoshino Sakura; the gentle and talented school idol, Shirakawa Kotori; and also Amakase Miharu, Sagisawa Yoriko, Mizukoshi Mako, and Mizukoshi Moe.

Watching their interactions with the protagonist, Asakura Junichi, sparking all kinds of engaging stories‚Äîthis represents a joyful life, a level of happiness I feel I could never possibly match in my own entire lifetime.

However, as much joy as the various jokes and memes brought in the first half of the story, the "bloodbath" love story in the later half was equally tragic.

Even though the ending was good, the sweet-then-tear-jerking plot was hard to shake off in my mind.

{{< image src="img/Screenshot_2013-04-05-12-15-34.png" caption="The rooftop confrontation between Asakura Nemu and Yoshino Sakura pushes the story to its climax. (The exact date of starting to watch anime should be the date when this screenshot was taken, but because Da Capo is related to sakura, and April is the time when sakura is in full bloom, so I later decided that each year, the anniversary of starting to watch anime is the time when sakura blooms.)" >}}

Ah, what a joyful, heart-wrenching yet beautiful story.

<!-- Because, these were the joys of getting along with girls, which I could never imagine. -->

However, every story has an end, and endlessly repeating an anime was not ideal.

"Go find the next anime, go find the next happiness, just like how we found Da Capo from AKB0048 initially."

I smiled with relief.

"However, choosing this path means you will join the Otaku crew and become one of them, being completely socially awkward and being more despised by others, including all the girls in your class. Are you willing?"

<!-- Hey, would I hesitate? I've had enough of the abyss. My thoughts, falling with the sakura in D.C., had drifted towards the beautiful world called "anime". -->

The sakura of Da Capo, fluttering in the gentle breeze, fell like a riot of colors. The anime world is so beautiful, why would I hesitate?
